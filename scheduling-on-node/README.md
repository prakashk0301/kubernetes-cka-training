# üß™ Advanced Kubernetes Scheduling Labs

> **Environment:**  
> Self-managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS Ubuntu EC2 instances  
> üñ•Ô∏è 1 Master Node  
> üñ•Ô∏è 2 Worker Nodes

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster is up and running
- `kubectl` configured and working
- Worker nodes are labeled to support affinity/anti-affinity scheduling

### üè∑Ô∏è Label Your Nodes

Apply labels to the worker nodes for testing:

```bash
kubectl label nodes <worker-node-1> disktype=ssd zone=us-east-1a
kubectl label nodes <worker-node-2> disktype=hdd zone=us-east-1b
```

Check the labels:

```bash
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Node Selector: 

nodeSelector is the simplest form of node scheduling constraint in Kubernetes. It is used to constrain a Pod to be scheduled only on nodes that have a specific label

### üßæ node-selector-pod.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-ssd
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
```

### üîç Description

This pod will only be scheduled on nodes labeled with `disktype=ssd`.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Node Affinity

### üßæ node-affinity-pod.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - us-east-1a
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

### üîç Description

- **Required:** Must be scheduled on nodes with `disktype=ssd`
- **Preferred:** Ideally run in `zone=us-east-1a`

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Pod Affinity

### üßæ base-pod.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: base-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

### üßæ pod-with-affinity.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    podAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: app
            operator: In
            values:
            - myapp
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

### üîç Description

The second pod will be scheduled on the **same node** where `base-pod` is running (based on label `app=myapp`).

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Pod Anti-Affinity

### üßæ pod-anti-affinity.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-anti-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: app
            operator: In
            values:
            - myapp
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

### üîç Description

This pod will **not be scheduled** on a node that already has a pod with the label `app=myapp`.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Taints and Tolerations

### üß™ Taint a Node

Run this to taint a worker node:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <worker-node-1> key=value:NoSchedule
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl describe node <worker-node-1> | grep Taint
```

### üßæ toleration-pod.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: toleration-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```

### üîç Description

This pod includes a toleration that matches the taint on the node, allowing it to be scheduled on it.

---

## üßπ Clean Up

To remove all pods:

```bash
kubectl delete pod pod-ssd pod-node-affinity base-pod pod-with-affinity pod-with-anti-affinity toleration-pod
```

To remove the taint from the node:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes <worker-node-1> key=value:NoSchedule-
```

## üìä Summary Table

| Feature            | Description                                                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node Selector      | Schedule a pod on a node with specific labels                         |
| Node Affinity      | Require or prefer node selection using `matchExpressions`             |
| Pod Affinity       | Schedule a pod close to another pod based on label match              |
| Pod Anti-Affinity  | Prevent pods from being scheduled on same node as others with labels  |
| Taints/Tolerations | Mark nodes as "special" and only allow matching pods to run on them   |

---

## üí° Tips

- Always use `topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"` for node-level pod affinity/anti-affinity.
- Test affinity and anti-affinity by deploying multiple pods and observing node placement.
- Use `kubectl get pods -o wide` to verify where pods are scheduled.
